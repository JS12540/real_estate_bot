# Real Estate RAG Chatbot ‚Äì Candidate Assessment

## Objective

Build an intelligent real estate chatbot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) that:

* **Answers property inquiries** accurately using factual data
* **Converts conversations into qualified leads** by capturing user intent and contact information
* **Maintains trust** through accurate, grounded responses with zero hallucinations
* **Guides users toward engagement** (scheduling viewings, requesting callbacks, etc.)

## Business Context

In real estate, every conversation is a potential lead. The chatbot must:
- Provide accurate property information to build trust
- Identify buying signals and capture lead information naturally
- Encourage next steps (property tours, agent calls, brochure downloads)
- Never provide false information that could damage credibility

## Requirements

### 1. Data Ingestion & RAG Pipeline

**Document Processing:**
- Ingest the **Al Badia Villas Floorplans PDF** (`data/ABV Final Floorplans.pdf`) containing:
  - Property details for Al Badia Villas in Dubai Festival City
  - 3, 4, and 5 bedroom villa configurations (Types: MIA, SHADEA, MODEA)
  - Floor plans, room dimensions, plot areas, built-up areas (BUA)
  - Villa specifications and layouts

**Multimodal Image Handling:**
- Ingest and index **floorplan images** from `data/WebP/` directory (use Rev11 versions)
- Map each image to corresponding villa type and specifications
- Implement image retrieval logic to return relevant floorplan images based on query
- **CRITICAL:** Response must include appropriate image paths when discussing specific villas


### 2. API Endpoint: `/chat`

**POST /chat**

```json
{
  "message": "I'm looking for a 4-bedroom villa with a pool in Dubai",
  "session_id": "user-123",
  "context": {
    "previous_properties_viewed": [],
    "lead_status": "new"
  }
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "response": "Great choice! Al Badia Villas in Dubai Festival City offers 4-bedroom villas (SHADEA model) with swimming pool options. These villas have 344 SQM total built-up area with spacious layouts including a master bedroom with walk-in closet, family area, and covered parking. The plot sizes range from 401-664 SQM. Would you like to see the floor plans?",
  "properties_mentioned": ["SHADEA-4BR-TYPE-B"],
  "citations": [{"source": "floorplans_pdf", "page": 7, "villa_type": "4BR Type B with Pool"}],
  "images": [
    {
      "path": "data/WebP/AlBadia_Floorplans_A3_Rev11-7.webp",
      "description": "4BR SHADEA Type B with swimming pool - Ground and first floor layout",
      "relevance": "floorplan"
    }
  ],
  "lead_signals": {
    "intent": "medium",
    "signals_detected": ["specific_requirements", "location_preference", "luxury_feature_interest"],
    "recommended_action": "show_floorplans_and_qualify"
  },
  "follow_up_prompt": "I can send you detailed floor plans and arrange a site visit. What's your preferred timeline for moving?"
}
```

### 3. Lead Generation Requirements

The chatbot must intelligently:

**Detect Buying Signals:**
- Budget mentions
- Specific property requirements (bedrooms, location, amenities)
- Timeline indicators ("looking to move by...", "need soon")
- Comparison questions between properties
- Questions about financing, documentation, or purchase process

**Capture Lead Information:**
- Name, phone, email (request naturally in conversation)
- Budget range
- Property preferences
- Timeline
- Current living situation (renting, selling existing property)

**Guide Toward Conversion:**
- Suggest property viewings
- Offer to connect with agents
- Provide downloadable brochures (email required)
- Schedule callbacks
- Send property comparisons via email

### 4. Retrieval Strategy & Guardrails

**Priority hierarchy:**
1. **Floorplans PDF first** ‚Üí Always query the Al Badia Villas PDF for:
   - Villa configurations and types
   - Exact dimensions and areas (SQM/SQFT)
   - Room layouts and counts
   - Plot sizes and built-up areas
2. **Visual references** ‚Üí Use floorplan images from `data/WebP/` to:
   - Show visual layout references
   - Validate spatial information
   - Provide visual confirmation of features
3. **General knowledge fallback** ‚Üí Use LLM knowledge only for:
   - Dubai Festival City location information
   - General real estate guidance
   - Amenities in the area
   - Market context
4. **Refuse when uncertain** ‚Üí Never hallucinate pricing, availability, or features not in the PDF

**Critical guardrails:**
- ‚ùå Never invent villa prices or availability (not in the PDF)
- ‚ùå Never contradict the floorplan specifications
- ‚ùå Never provide square footage outside the documented ranges
- ‚ùå Never add features not shown in the floorplans
- ‚úÖ Always cite the PDF page number for villa specifications
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge when pricing/availability needs agent confirmation
- ‚úÖ Provide exact dimensions from the floorplans
- ‚úÖ Offer to connect with sales team for pricing and availability

### 5. LLM Integration

- Use any LLM (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source)
- Implement prompt engineering for:
  - Conversational, helpful tone
  - Lead qualification questions
  - Natural information capture
  - Urgency creation without being pushy


## Deliverables

- Use only Rev11 images from `data/WebP/` directory
- Never use superseded versions from `_Superati/` folder
- Always cite PDF page numbers for factual claims

### Lead Generation Focus
